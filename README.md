# Saturn-Agent: Leveraging NLWeb for Natural Language Web Interaction

This project explores the use of Microsoft's open-source Natural Language Web (NLWeb) tool to convert website data into natural language APIs. This enables AI agents to query website data efficiently, acting as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

## Core Concept: NLWeb

Microsoft's open-source Natural Language Web (NLWeb) is a pivotal tool that transforms website data into accessible natural language APIs. This conversion allows AI agents to query and interact with web data as if it were an MCP server. NLWeb is designed with platform agnosticism in mind, ensuring compatibility with major platforms, various vector databases, and a wide range of large language models (LLMs).

## Integration with Cloudflare Stack

A key aspect of this project is the integration of NLWeb with Cloudflare's suite of tools: Workers, Workers AI, and Vectorize.

### Components

1.  **Microsoft NLWeb (Open-Source):**
    *   Converts website content (e.g., text, structured data) into natural language APIs.
    *   Operates as an MCP server, allowing AI agents to query data semantically.
    *   Supports integration with vector databases and LLMs, as it's designed to be compatible with various platforms.

2.  **Cloudflare Workers:**
    *   A serverless platform for running JavaScript/TypeScript code at the edge.
    *   Ideal for handling API requests, orchestrating workflows, and integrating with external services like NLWeb.

3.  **Cloudflare Workers AI:**
    *   Provides serverless GPU-powered AI inference.
    *   Includes text embedding models (e.g., `@cf/baai/bge-small-en-v1.5`, 768 dimensions).
    *   Supports LLMs for tasks like text generation or semantic analysis.

4.  **Cloudflare Vectorize:**
    *   Cloudflare's vector database for storing and querying embeddings.
    *   Optimized for semantic search, recommendations, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
    *   Supports up to 5 million vectors per index with approximately 31ms median query latency.

### Integration Feasibility

The integration of NLWeb with Cloudflare's stack is highly feasible and offers a powerful solution. This synergy leverages:

*   **NLWeb:** To extract and process website data into natural language representations or embeddings.
*   **Cloudflare Workers:** To orchestrate API calls between NLWeb, Workers AI, and Vectorize.
*   **Cloudflare Workers AI:** To generate embeddings from NLWeb's output or enhance NLP tasks.
*   **Cloudflare Vectorize:** To store and query embeddings for semantic search or RAG, enabling context-aware AI applications.

This combination allows for the development of sophisticated AI agents capable of understanding and interacting with web content in a natural and efficient manner.
